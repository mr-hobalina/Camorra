<h1><u><strong>Character Creation</strong></u></h1>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Camorra does not use archetypes or subclasses.</p>
<p>Instead, each class gains flexible tools that can be applied in multiple ways depending on the situation.</p>
<p>A character’s role is defined by decisions, positioning, and pressure. Not by permanent build paths.</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Intro</strong></h2>
<p>All characters start with -1 in their ability scores, except for toughness which starts at 0. Players get 6 points to put into their characters ability scores and put them wherever they wish. When creating a character, the max ability score a character can have is 3. </p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Pick Your Class</strong></h2>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first thing you should do is pick your class. After you have picked your class, Put your Hit Dice on the character sheet and apply your classes starting attributes. We will use the Advisor as an example. The Advisor has 2D4 as its Hit Dice. The Advisor starts with a +1 to Charisma and +1 to Intelligence. This would make your starting Intelligence and Charisma 0. Next we select our main stat to use as our save DC. The Advisor can choose from either Intelligence or Charisma. The save DC = 10+Main Stat+Proficiency Bonus. At level 1, the Proficiency Bonus is 1. Make sure you put the abilities you start with into the abilities section on the character sheet, also do this on each level up so you can always have them available. Before we add our HP, it&#x27;s best to select your background and nationality first. </p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Pick Your Background and Nationality </strong></h2>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>When picking your background, it is often best to pick or create one that aligns with your character, however, the choice is yours. We will use the Lawyer background as an example. The Lawyer starts with +1 in Charisma and +1 in Intelligence. We now add these to our ability scores, making Charisma and Intelligence 1 for this character. The Lawyer also gets proficiency in Law and two other skills from the choices that are in the Lawyer background. We tick the box next to the Law skill and the other two that you have chosen, this means when we make a skill check with it, we add our Proficiency Bonus to it. It also comes with an ability which you can add to the ability section on the character sheet. </p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>When picking your nationality, they will come with perks. Add these to your abilities. Also, when you pick your nationality, you also know the language of that nationality. All characters know at least the basics of Camorran, which is the main language of Camorra. </p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Traits</strong></h2>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>When creating your character, they must have a positive trait and a negative trait. What that is, is up to you. You can pick from the list or make your own. </p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Applying Ability Scores and HP</strong></h2>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are now at the point of using our points to add to our ability scores. You get a total of 6 to add to your character. Remember that you cannot go higher than 3 in an ability score when creating a character. After you have applied your points, it&#x27;s time to add your HP (Hit Points). For the advisor, its starting health is 15+2D4+Toughness. Roll 2D4, add the 15 and whatever your Toughness is. If your toughness is still -1, you take 1 off the total HP.  Remember to add your ability scores to your saving throws. You will be proficient in your two main stats, so remember to add your proficiency bonus to them. </p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Pick Your Starting Items</strong></h2>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Characters don&#x27;t start with weapons or outfits unless they get one with their background. Characters do get to choose some starting items/Languages. You can pick up to 3 items. Some items count as 2 of your 3 and you may only pick one language. After you have picked your starting items, your character is created. </p>
<p class="spacer">&nbsp;</p>
<p>All characters start with 5 Notes in cash. </p>
